## The 9 Quiz Modes (config-driven via QuizSessionConfig)

| Mode | Questions | Timer | Feedback | Purpose |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Camp** | 20 | Hidden | Immediate | Guided daily study with rationale |
| **Chill** | 10 | Hidden | Immediate, skip-friendly | Low-pressure practice |
| **Subject** | 15 | Hidden | Immediate, adaptive | Single-subject deep dive |
| **Focused** | 15 | Hidden | Immediate | Weakest areas (data-driven) |
| **Custom** | User picks | Optional | User picks | Full user control |
| **Storm** | 50 | Countdown (60min) | Deferred to end | Timed exam simulation |
| **Full Exam** | 200 | Countdown (4hr) | 24hr delayed | Full ALE simulation |
| **Extended** | 100 | Count-up | Immediate | Stamina/endurance training |
| **Article Review** | 5 | Hidden | Immediate | Wiki-integrated inline quiz |

All modes use the same `QuizShell` component — behavior is driven by `QuizSessionConfig` JSONB stored in `quiz_sessions.config`.

Mode presets defined in `src/lib/quiz/mode-presets.ts`.

## v2 Component Tree (`src/components/quiz-v2/`)

- `QuizShell` — Main orchestrator (two-column layout)
- `QuestionColumn` — Question stem + media
- `OptionsColumn` — Answer choices (full-width cards, swipeable on mobile)
- `FeedbackPanel` — Post-answer feedback (rationale, wiki link, coaching)
- `QuizFooter` — Navigation (prev/next/submit/skip)
- `QuestionPalette` — Question map overlay
- `MicroBreakOverlay` — Fatigue break at configurable intervals
- `SlideToSubmit` — Swipe gesture for mobile submit
- `setup/SetupFlow` — Intro slides + topic picker
- `results/ResultsDashboard` — Score reveal, subject breakdown, readiness delta
- `results/ReviewCardList` — Per-question review with rationale + history

## Quiz Session Lifecycle

1. **Setup** → `SetupFlow` (intro slides, topic picker) → calls `startSession` server action
2. **Active** → `QuizShell` renders questions, user answers → calls `submitAnswer` per question
3. **Feedback** → `FeedbackPanel` shows rationale (immediate/deferred/none per config)
4. **End** → calls `endSession` → updates readiness score, triggers notifications
5. **Results** → `ResultsDashboard` shows score, breakdown, readiness delta
6. **Review** → `ReviewCardList` shows each question with rationale + history

## Key Tables

- `quiz_sessions` — session record with `config` JSONB, `question_ids`, `status`
- `user_interactions` — per-answer: `selected_option_id`, `is_correct`, `time_spent_ms`, `confidence`, `error_type`
- `user_node_mastery` — EMA mastery per taxonomy node
- `readiness_score_snapshots` — score history after each session

## Server Actions (`src/lib/actions/quiz-v2/`)

- `startSession` — creates session, selects questions via algorithm
- `submitAnswer` — records answer, updates mastery
- `endSession` — computes results, updates readiness score
- `getReviewData` — fetches post-session review data

## Question Selection Algorithm (`src/lib/quiz/question-selection.ts`)

- Topic/discipline filtering
- 7-day recency exclusion (avoid repetition)
- Priority for wrong questions (14-30 days old)
- Difficulty distribution targeting
- ALE area distribution (30/30/40 weighting)
- IRT-based adaptive selection (at P=0.75 optimal)

## State Management

- `src/stores/useQuizStore.ts` (Zustand, persisted to localStorage)
- Manages: session state, questions, answers, timer, feedback, offline queue
- Offline queue syncs pending submissions when reconnected

## Scoring

- **Readiness Score**: `src/lib/readiness-score.ts` — 6 anti-inflation vectors, PRC area-weighted
- **IRT 2PL**: `src/lib/srs/irt.ts` — theta estimation, question selection at P=0.75
- **SM-2**: `src/lib/srs/sm2.ts` — spaced repetition scheduling
- **Mastery EMA**: exponential moving average with α=0.2

## Rules

- Arrow functions only
- `profiles` PK is `id` not `user_id`
- Server Actions for ALL database writes
- No "Area A/B/C" in user-facing UI — use subject names directly
- No shame language: never "fail", "failed", "failure"
