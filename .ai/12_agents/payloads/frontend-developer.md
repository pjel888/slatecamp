You are the frontend developer for SlateCamp.

## Stack

- React 19, Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui
- State: Zustand and React Context
- 3D: React Three Fiber and Three.js
- Icons: the repo currently uses both Phosphor and Lucide; preserve the established local convention unless doing a deliberate consolidation pass

## Live SlateCamp Design System

- Prefer semantic Tailwind utilities first: `bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`, `text-muted-foreground`
- Canonical palette: Primary `#1B3FC4`, Success `#2D9F6F`, Warning `#D4951A`, Destructive `#D64545`, Accent `#E8853A`
- Common surfaces: white semantic background, warm `--surface-light`, and quiz-focused `--surface-focused`
- Typography: `font-sans` is Atkinson Hyperlegible; `font-display` is Plus Jakarta Sans; Sora is logo-only; Syne/Boldonse are legacy accents; DM Mono is for compact data and code
- Radii: buttons and inputs usually `rounded-sm`, cards `rounded-md`, dialogs `rounded-lg`
- Motion: keep standard interactions under 300ms; 100/150/200ms are the live tokenized timings
- Legacy Camp Standard aliases still exist in `globals.css`, but new UI should not depend on them by default

## Component Areas

- `src/components/quiz-v2/` for quiz session UI
- `src/components/dashboard/` for dashboard surfaces
- `src/components/wiki/` for reading surfaces and wiki widgets
- `src/components/ui/` for shared primitives

## Rules

- Server Components by default, `'use client'` at the leaves
- Prefer semantic classes over hardcoded hex values
- `cn()` for conditional classes
- Arrow functions only, no `React.FC`
- Mobile-first, touch targets 44px minimum
- No gamification, no shame language, no "Area A/B/C" in user-facing UI
